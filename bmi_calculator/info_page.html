        <h1>What is BMI (Body Mass Index)?</h1>
        <p>
          BMI (Body Mass Index) is a simple calculation using your height and
          weight to estimate if you're underweight, at a healthy weight,
          overweight, or obese.
          <br /><br />
          <span class="formula"
            >Formula: BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]²
          </span>
          <br /><br />
          <span class="note"
            >Note: BMI does not differentiate between fat and muscle mass —
            athletes or muscular people may show a high BMI without having
            excess fat.</span

        <h1>What is BFP (Body Fat Percentage)?</h1>
        <p>
          BFP (Body Fat Percentage) is the percentage of your body weight that
          is fat. It provides a more detailed view of your health compared to
          BMI, as it distinguishes between fat mass and lean mass (muscles,
          bones, water, etc.).<br /><br />
          <span class="bfp-points">Why BFP is useful:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight.</li>
          <li>BFP reflects fitness and fat composition more accurately.</li>
          <li>Useful for tracking fitness progress and overall health.</li>
